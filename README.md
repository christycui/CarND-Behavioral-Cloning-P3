Overview
---
Driving data is collected by driving in a simulated environment. The goal is to use deep learning and build a neural network that clones human driving and makes the car drive itself in a simulator.


File Description

* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results
* run1.mp4 a video of the car driving itself around the track completing the full loop
